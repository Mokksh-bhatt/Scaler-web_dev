    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>

    <p>Yo Wassup, I find just as much joy in sketching a UI on paper as bringing it to life in code. Whether I’m designing intuitive experiences, experimenting with AI, or building something for the web, I’m always in that space between creativity and logic, where ideas become real.

I’ve never been one to just talk about things—I learn best by doing, tinkering, building. My curiosity pulls me toward how things work, how people feel when using them, and how technology can be both beautiful and useful. You’ll usually find my tabs full of design tools, dev docs, and the occasional nature trail I plan to wander.

There are days when I’m deep in code, fully in flow. Other days, I’m out soaking in the world around me—quietly observing, recharging, and returning with fresh inspiration.

At the core, I just like making things that feel good to use and make people’s lives a little easier, smarter, or more meaningful.</p>
